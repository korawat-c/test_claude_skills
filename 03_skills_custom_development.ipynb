    "### What are Custom Skills?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Custom skills** are specialized expertise packages you create to teach Claude your organization's unique workflows, domain knowledge, and best practices. Unlike Anthropic's pre-built skills (Excel, PowerPoint, PDF), custom skills allow you to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Codify organizational knowledge** - Capture your team's specific methodologies\n",
    "- **Ensure consistency** - Apply the same standards across all interactions\n",
    "- **Automate complex workflows** - Chain together multi-step processes\n",
    "- **Maintain intellectual property** - Keep proprietary methods secure\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "| Benefit | Description |\n",
    "|---------|-------------|\n",
    "| **Expertise at Scale** | Deploy specialized knowledge to every Claude interaction |\n",
    "| **Version Control** | Track changes and roll back if needed |\n",
    "| **Composability** | Combine multiple skills for complex tasks |\n",
    "| **Privacy** | Your skills remain private to your organization |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",

Understanding Custom Skills Architecture {#architecture}\n\n### Skill Structure\n\nEvery custom skill follows this directory structure:\n\n```\nskill_name/\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SKILL.md           # REQUIRED: Instructions with YAML frontmatter\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ *.md               # Optional: Any additional .md files (documentation, guides)\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ scripts/           # Optional: Executable code\n‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ process.py\n‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ utils.js\n‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ resources/         # Optional: Templates, data files\n    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ template.xlsx\n```\n\n**Important:** \n- **SKILL.md is the ONLY required file** - everything else is optional\n- **Multiple .md files allowed** - You can have any number of markdown files in the top-level folder\n- **All .md files are loaded** - Not just SKILL.md and REFERENCE.md, but any .md file you include\n- **Organize as needed** - Use multiple .md files to structure complex documentation\n\nüìñ Read our engineering blog post on [Equipping agents for the real world with Skills](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/equipping-agents-for-the-real-world-with-agent-skills)\n\n### Skills Are Not Just Markdown\n\n![Skills Can Include Scripts and Files](../assets/not-just-markdown.png)\n\nSkills can bundle various file types:\n- **Markdown files**: Instructions and documentation (SKILL.md, REFERENCE.md, etc.)\n- **Scripts**: Python, JavaScript, or other executable code for complex operations\n- **Templates**: Pre-built files that can be customized (Excel templates, document templates)\n- **Resources**: Supporting data files, configuration, or assets\n\n### SKILL.md Requirements\n\nThe `SKILL.md` file must include:\n\n1. **YAML Frontmatter** (name: 64 chars, description: 1024 chars)\n   - `name`: Lowercase alphanumeric with hyphens (required)\n   - `description`: Brief description of what the skill does (required)\n\n2. **Instructions** (markdown format)\n   - Clear guidance for Claude\n   - Examples of usage\n   - Any constraints or rules\n   - Recommended: Keep under 5,000 tokens\n\n### Additional Documentation Files\n\nYou can include multiple markdown files for better organization:\n\n```\nskill_name/\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SKILL.md           # Main instructions (required)\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ REFERENCE.md       # API reference (optional)\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ EXAMPLES.md        # Usage examples (optional)\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ TROUBLESHOOTING.md # Common issues (optional)\n‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ CHANGELOG.md       # Version history (optional)\n```\n\nAll `.md` files in the root directory will be available to Claude when the skill is loaded.\n\n### Bundled Files Example\n\n![Bundled Files in Skills](../assets/skills-bundled-files.png)\n\nThis example shows how Skills can bundle multiple files:\n- **SKILL.md**: Contains the main instructions with colors, typography, and sections\n- **slide-decks.md**: Additional documentation for specific use cases\n- **Scripts and resources**: Can be referenced and used during skill execution\n\n### Progressive Disclosure\n\nSkills load in three stages to optimize token usage:\n\n| Stage | Content | Token Cost | When Loaded |\n|-------|---------|------------|-------------|\n| **1. Metadata** | Name & description | name: 64 chars, description: 1024 chars | Always visible |\n| **2. Instructions** | All .md files | <5,000 tokens recommended | When relevant |\n| **3. Resources** | Scripts & files | As needed | During execution |\n\n### API Workflow\n\n```python\n# 1. Create skill\nskill = client.beta.skills.create(\n    display_title=\"My Skill\",\n    files=files_from_dir(\"path/to/skill\")\n)\n\n# 2. Use in messages\nresponse = client.beta.messages.create(\n    container={\n        \"skills\": [{\n            \"type\": \"custom\",\n            \"skill_id\": skill.id,\n            \"version\": \"latest\"\n        }]\n    },\n    # ... rest of message parameters\n)\n```\n\n### Best Practices\n\nFor detailed guidance on skill creation and best practices, see:\n- [Claude Skills Best Practices](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/best-practices)\n- [Skills Documentation](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview)"

Best Practices & Production Tips {#best-practices}\n\n### Skill Design Principles\n\n1. **Single Responsibility**: Each skill should focus on one area of expertise\n2. **Clear Documentation**: SKILL.md should be comprehensive yet concise\n3. **Error Handling**: Scripts should handle edge cases gracefully\n4. **Version Control**: Use Git to track skill changes\n5. **Testing**: Always test skills before production deployment\n\n### Directory Structure Best Practices\n\n```\ncustom_skills/\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ financial_analyzer/       # Single purpose, clear naming\n‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SKILL.md             # Under 5,000 tokens\n‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ scripts/             # Modular Python/JS files\n‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tests/               # Unit tests for scripts\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ brand_guidelines/         # Organizational standards\n‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SKILL.md\n‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ REFERENCE.md         # Additional documentation\n‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ assets/              # Logos, templates\n```\n\n### Performance Optimization\n\n| Strategy | Impact | Implementation |\n|----------|--------|----------------|\n| **Minimal Frontmatter** | Faster skill discovery | name: 64 chars, description: 1024 chars |\n| **Lazy Loading** | Reduced token usage | Reference files only when needed |\n| **Skill Composition** | Avoid duplication | Combine skills vs. mega-skill |\n| **Caching** | Faster responses | Reuse skill containers |\n\n### Security Considerations\n\n- **API Keys**: Never hardcode credentials in skills\n- **Data Privacy**: Don't include sensitive data in skill files\n- **Access Control**: Skills are workspace-specific\n- **Validation**: Sanitize inputs in scripts\n- **Audit Trail**: Log skill usage for compliance"
